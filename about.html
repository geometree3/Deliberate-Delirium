<p>Deliberate Delirium is a creative community of abstract proportions. In a world of structure and definition, there is seemingly no place for the unstructured and indefinable. It is our objective to change that. This is a place where abstract ideas can thrive, and expression of them is encouraged. We believe that the key to life is imagination. This is why children are more alive, but are conditioned to adopt limiting belief systems in order to 'grow up' into zombies whose objective is to survive but not to live. We won't conform to the condescending, we'd prefer to transform until we're all transcending. We're here to transform squares into circles, and redefine reality. We have the right to live, play, and create. Life is art, and magic. We can be anything we imagine. We invite you to join our lucid creativity. The main goal is to create a comfortable and progressive atmosphere for creative expression and ideas. To maintain that atmosphere, it is important not to place limitations. We want it to be as free and unlimited as possible, so the only thing we ask that you check your ego and your preconceived notions of reality and what is and isn't possible at the door. Without judgment, there is only perfection. Free your mind from restraints and unlock infinite possibilities. Don't hesitate, just create and don't forget to have fun.</p>
