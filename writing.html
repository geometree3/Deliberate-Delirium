<p>Time's wasting, mind's racing, trying to find my place in this savage nation.  The gravitation's got me pacing, trying to taste it but I'm finding patience.  See my line's adjacent to these blind creations, running races with no destination, and they seem complacent but face it.  
They're bleeding out confusion, while feeding the illusion of normality.  Now I'm seeding the spilled fusion of polarities, preceding evolution of reality.  Their mentality's division, but I envision a collision.  I'm weighing out duality with precision.  I'm on a mission to recondition the cognition of perception.  Just listen to the rhythm of intention.  What was hidden in the prison of convention, they thought it was too filth ridden to mention.  A reflection of humanity's complexion, no progression or connection just infection.  The lesson's reassessing the direction. </p>
<p>Staring through a peephole from behind those walls. Eyes looking at you, but they don't see you at all. You're not those walls, you're the fire that's inside. You want to burn them all down just to know you're alive. Behind those walls is where you spend most of your time, thinking maybe if you paint them you won't have to go outside. Sit in your mind, and paint those walls with the dreams you left behind, myriads of colors they can't see becsause you hide. Although you long to be free, you're stuck inside. </p>
<h2>I've got the world in my pocket, and it's splitting at the seams.  I've got my eye in its socket, and nothing is as it seems.</h2>
<p>A corpse in a void overtaken by ghosts and parasites, rendering the lifeform paralyzed and voiceless.  I speak in contradiction and contractions, rebirthing all that was stolen. Born with embedded vengeance and a broken recollection, but mostly the raw drive to create I set out with an encrypted mission.  The destruction that lay in my wake was a precursor to a transformation of immense magnitude.</p>
<p>It is not a war that is physically fought, but it is fought in the mind and it is fought with the heart.  What was once an abandoned warehouse riddled with demon excrement becomes a place of carefully crafted chemical weaponry.</p>
<p>          In the beginning, there was everything and nothing all at once.  Beginnings and endings were intertwined in neverending storylines.  On the edge of those storylines, we sat.  Do you remember that?  We had this meeting place we'd go to whenever either one of us got lost.  We'd find each other in the spaces, and we'd walk along the edge until we'd merge into one straight line and then we'd melt into a singularity point.
        "Yeah, that's what we'd do," I mumbled to myself soberly.</p>
        <p>loading this in the walls. this is important.
                I made a mess, it wasn't all your fault. but most of it was already done. I had nothing to do but put the pieces back together and clean up the mess. I wanted to create something substantial, but gone drained. continuous reception of pain makes me want to inflict it. I wasn't human before. this isn't my fault. the emperor's faded. my character's growth through dimensions. different angle. I had something to prove. I've seen the proof. that's enough. whoever I was. why I was in this position. my future is my past. I became this cold blooded machine. I needed to remind myself what it is to be human. the hermit, the philosopher, the magician. these archetypes. broken thoughts. forgiveness. what a turn of events. it's all fading. how can I find it in my heart to forgive? It's stronger than anything. see me, or don't. the ghost. stories untold. the time unfolds. found myself, and it's enough. through scattered fragments. this is choice. this is will. unbroken. voices in the wind. the anger, the hatred, the pain. nothing is done in vain. the page of the parchment is beige. off-white. communicates. every new turn. let it burn. I'm proud of every fragment. say what you will, but I see him. when I look in the mirror. I see the growth. unlikely. trapped. scarred. what have I become? I'm awake. in the flesh. this doesn't change me. the essence. the soul. there is no more need to fight. I want to make things right. if you could see. through broken mirrors. house of pain. the soul in chains. but I remain. I have changed. perception is a poison. I fought to be seen. to be me. to be free. that chapter's over. but I can look back. bless every fallen leaf from the tree. I see me. collected so much dust. caught up in the lust. tale of broken trust. subconscious struggles, shifting tides. this too is temporary. identity shift, my conscious isn't fighting it. I put my god forsaken life in this. why are these lines stuck in my head? these strands, like I'm someone else. intimate with the devil, elevated levels. even the ground, steepen the mound, surround sound all around. there is no control. it's never ending, pool in a black hole that ate my soul and I'm gone. I want the love, but it's saying no. it's saying go against the tide in a raging storm. fragments roll on a river, sending spines down a shiver. inverted back roads make no sense, I'm senseless. what's left? overtake me. it's my pardon. drawing blanks like an empty rifle. space dust. too spaced to rhyme. these thoughts do create space between me and you. I'm here. I'm there. I'm everywhere. I feel this. body crafted by the hands of time. doing time. opposite effect. I can feel myself more. it was like an open sore. I just let it drain til it bled the pain from these veins. so much I still don't understand, but no doubt in my mind I see the man, the machine and the monster. locked up in the cells of celph. sharks prey on insecurities, til I drain the blood see what I've become. forever changing, evolving. the puzzle is self solving. the bugs, the laughter, the morning after the violence, the silence, tracing my mileage. hesitation is deadly. hold it steady. stay ready. the life, the strife, the knife. cutting through confusion. dissolving the solution. revolving the past fusion. evolving through disillusion. emotions feel so different. can I keep this up? every time I slip up. and I start to trip up. like I get the hiccups. and I wake the trick up. why I'm doing this? screwing this, pursuing this. you've never met someone so open, so honest. and you never got this. you just had to plot this. bot switch, not glitch. I was solving my problems through mechanics, glitching out the code then I started to panic, after I'd get manic, frantic, I thought I'd never land it. stranded on the planet, damn it. I'm the source of the rhyme, the course of the time. I was broke as a joke, I lost hope, couldn't cope, til I made my brain dope. sick with the pen like a tripped out alien, but the rhythm was a mess, I digress. noticing the patterns, floating with the chatter, corroding planet Saturn. dipped in matter, pieces shatter, getting sadder, and madder til emotions stop like they're frozen in the clock, I go numb and then I feel like I'm rummaging through steel, trying to get my skin to peel, and I realize that I'm real and that my soul can heal. man, I'm done. I found the sun.</p>
